I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) advised by Prof. Prof. Qingyi Gu. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Central South Unversity (CSU) in 2019. 


My research interest includes machine learning and pattern recognition, with focus on Efficient Training and Inference Methods for Networks, including knowledge distillation, Neural architecture search and Network quantization. I served as a reviewer for ACMM'21.
